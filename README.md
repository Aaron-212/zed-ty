# Ty for Zed

> [!WARNING]
> Ty is still in development and is not ready for production use. Please do not use it in production environments.

> [!CAUTION]
> Doesn't work for now. I'm still investigating why.

Zed extension for Python type checker [astral-sh/ty](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty).

Because Ty is in development so no built binary is available in Zed directely.
You need to install one externally, for example with `uv tool install ty`.
